# Customer Segmentation Using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project was created by **Team Neural Nexus** as part of the **BITS Digital MS in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (First Trimester Project)**.  
Our objective was to apply **data analysis and machine learning techniques** to segment customers based on purchasing behavior and identify meaningful patterns that can support business decision-making.

***

## Project Goals

- Clean and preprocess real-world retail transaction data.  
- Explore customer trends and spending behavior.  
- Engineer features such as **recency, frequency, and monetary** metrics (RFM).  
- Apply **clustering algorithms** to group customers into meaningful segments.  
- Generate insights for potential marketing and retention strategies.

***

## Workflow Summary

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Removed missing values and inconsistent records.  
2. **EDA:** Explored sales patterns and customer distribution.  
3. **Feature Engineering:** Created RFM and supporting behavioral features.  
4. **Clustering:** Segmented customers using machine learning methods.  
5. **Interpretation:** Summarized segment insights for possible business use.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python (pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)**  
- **Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook**  
- **Dataset:** Online Retail (UCI Repository)

***

## Deliverables

- Jupyter Notebook: Complete workflow from preprocessing to clustering.  
- Processed Dataset: Final data with customer segments.  
- Documentation: Overview and insights summary.
